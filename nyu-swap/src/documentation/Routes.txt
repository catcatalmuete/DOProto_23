React Router
- Makes a request for index.html, bundle.js, and API endpoint calls
    - bundle js: looks at the current address and decides what content to show and applies different routing rules
    - React see a user clicks a link and intercepts the usual navigation event
    - the address bar updates so the user thinks they are going to a page
    - react renders a new page/component based on the route

Open console console type console.log(window.location), expand and see pathname.

window.history.pushState( {}, ‘’, ‘/button')

Clicking on a link:
react component called Link({to})
event.prevemntDefault() stops standard navigation
handleClick to detect a click
window.history.pushstate({}, “”, /route1)
window.history.pushstate({}, “”, /route2)

Add an event listener for a popstate event
