React Router
- Makes a request for index.html, bundle.js, and API endpoint calls
    - bundle js: looks at the current address and decides what content to show and applies different routing rules
    - React see a user clicks a link and intercepts the usual navigation event
    - the address bar updates so the user thinks they are going to a page
    - react renders a new page/component based on the route

Open console console type console.log(window.location), expand and see pathname.

window.history.pushState( {}, ‘’, ‘/button')

Clicking on a link:
react component called Link({to})
event.prevemntDefault() stops standard navigation
handleClick to detect a click
window.history.pushstate({}, “”, /route1)
window.history.pushstate({}, “”, /route2)

Add an event listener for a popstate event

Change the content on the screen:

import {useContext} from 'react'
import NavigationContext from '../context/navigation'
export default function Route({path, children}) {
  const {currentPath} = useContext(NavigationContext)

  if (path === currentPath) {
    return {children}
  } else {
    return null
  }
}

App.js: import Route component and pages

import Link from './components/Link'
import Route from './components/Route'
import AccordionPage from './pages/AccordionPage'
import ButtonPage from './pages/ButtonPage'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/accordion">Go to accordion</Link>
      <Link to="/button">Go to buttons</Link>
      <div>
        <Route path="/accordion">
          <AccordionPage />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/button">
          <ButtonPage />
        </Route>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
